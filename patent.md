# Freeze/Kill Runtime Patent Memo

**Title:** Method and Apparatus for Safe Freezing and Termination of Autonomous AI Runtime Processes

**Abstract:**

This document outlines a conceptual patent for a mechanism that allows a distributed AI runtime environment (GinieSystem) to be securely frozen and later resumed, or forcefully terminated without leaving residual processes. The purpose is to facilitate maintenance, upgrades or emergency shutdown while preserving the integrity of runtime data.

**Claims:**

1. A `freeze_runtime()` function that serializes runtime state into an archive and stores it in a secure snapshot location.
2. A `kill_processes()` function that identifies and terminates all running processes associated with the AI system.
3. A logging mechanism that records all actions taken by the freeze and kill operations for forensic analysis.
4. Optional automated restart of the system after a freeze or kill operation if configured.

**Description:**

The freeze operation uses file system snapshots to capture the working directory and relevant runtime data. This archive can later be unpacked to restore the system to its previous state. The kill operation sends signals to all processes matching a configurable pattern (e.g. the process name `ginie-system`), ensuring a complete shutdown. Logging ensures that operators have a reliable record of these critical operations.
